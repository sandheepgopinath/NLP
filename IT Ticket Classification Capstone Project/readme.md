-----------------------Details about the content of the Project Folder-----------------------


1. Project_Capstone_EDA+Preprocessing_Final.ipynb  - Contains the EDA and Preprocessing steps done to dataset
2. Project_Capstone_Model_Building_Final2_0.ipynb  - Contains the Model Building algorithms done on the data after pre-processing
3. Project_Capstone_Model_Building_Final2_1.ipynb  - This is a bencmark document, where the same model building is done on a bigger dataset, where the data is not normalised. 
We had dropped some rows which didnt have enough information, during the preprocessing steps.
The benchmarking is done to show the need of more data, to get better results. 
4. Result_Summary.ipynb                            - Notebook summarising all the results from the process
5. FinalReport-Version2_final.pdf                  - PDF Version of the final report
6. FinalReport-Version2_final.docx                 - DOC Version of final report
